# This file makes Python treat the 'python_ibgib' directory as a package.
# This helps in organizing and importing modules from this directory.

# Optionally, you can make functions from ibgib_helper directly available 
# when importing python_ibgib, e.g.:
# from .ibgib_helper import to_normalized_for_hashing, sha256v1

# For now, keeping it simple. Users will import via:
# from python_ibgib.ibgib_helper import ...
